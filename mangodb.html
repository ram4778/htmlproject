MongoDB is a source-available, cross-platform, document-oriented database
       program. Classified as a NoSQL database product, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents
        with optional schemas. Released in February 2009 by 10gen (now MongoDB Inc.),
         it supports features like sharding, replication, and ACID transactions (from version 4.0).
          MongoDB Atlas, its managed cloud service, operates on AWS, Google Cloud Platform, 
          and Microsoft Azure. Current versions are licensed under the Server Side Public License (SSPL).</pre
