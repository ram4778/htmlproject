JavaScript (JS)[a] is a programming language and core technology of the Web,
       alongside HTML and CSS. It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995.[6] Ninety-nine
        percent of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.[10]
      Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code.
       These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps.
        The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.</pre
