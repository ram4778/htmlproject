Java is a high-level, general-purpose, memory-safe, object-oriented programming 
      language. It is intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),
      [17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java
       without the need to recompile.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to
        bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying 
        computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer
         low-level facilities than either of them. </pre
