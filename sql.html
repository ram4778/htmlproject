SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in
     1986 and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.
     [11] Since then, the standard has been revised multiple times to include a larger
      set of features and incorporate common extensions. Despite the existence of 
      standards, virtually no implementations in existence adhere to it fully, 
      and most SQL code requires at least some changes before being ported to different
       database systems.</pre
